# Sudoku
A Sudoku Application made for the 2022 SDSU Programming Design Competition ( Plot twist, it sucks and 15 year old me clearly had no idea what he was doing ) I think it also just crashes sometimes :) Not supprising as the algorithm was developed by me.

# Notes
- All code is in MainWindow.xaml.cs ( Couldnt tell you why )
- I'm rebuilding the algorithm in C to see if I was cooking ( I wasn't, but I'm coping ) so if thats up by the time you see this 
please dont look at it my ego is already too small.
- If you want to, you can see the difference in coding styles from then to now by looking at [no-make](https://github.com/Zb1ndev/no-make)
